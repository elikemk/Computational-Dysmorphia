# Computational-Dysmorphia-
Context 

In a world of mass entertainment, computational consumption, and contiguous social media, how can identity be identified when reality is creatively distorted.The interesting thing to point out in the context of identifiable technology is what are the outcomes of simulated identical technology. Still, the rate of technology expansion is changing and evolving each day. Every day we become an identity that is merged with how our modern day AI models view us. Similar to body dysmorphia where we think one thing about ourselves and our body based on the beliefs and thoughts tied to our subconscious. Computational Dysmorphia is similar, it a term created to foster an ongoing trend where humans Dissociation between their identity and their pre-influencer identity and describes the psychological effects when interacting with curated digital environments and algorithms that distort how humans perceive their identity and what is worth. In total Computational Dysmorphia is a phenomenon that leads to a distorted sense of self shaped by cultural trends and digital norms. 


Purpose

The goal of this website is to introduce users to the phenomenon of interactiveness and artificial visual arts. My goal is to share my definition of what computational dysmorphia means to me which is a distortion of yourself, it's not a sickness and it's not some malice. However, if the machine itself the algorithms are the vital reason for your distort
